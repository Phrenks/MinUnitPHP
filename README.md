MinUnitPHP is a Unit Testing library for PHP. It's inspired in the MinUnit
C library that I found at http://www.jera.com/techinfo/jtns/jtn002.html. In
fact, I've even kept some function names.

Installation
============

All you need to do is include the file 'minunit.php' in your project and
include it in those files from which you wish to perform the unit testing.

Example
=======

Two examples are provided:
* minunit_example.php: An example for testing individual functions.
* minunit_class_example.php: An example for testing functions within a class.
